# degenerate_cavity_calculations
Codes for the calculation of the electromagnetic field propagation inside a degenerate optical cavity, using the angular spectrum propagation method

README file to run the cavity simulation codes

- first install the packages efield-master and fresnel-cavity-master with pip install -e NAMEOFFOLDER 
(this will call the setup.py files in each folder)


1) code "low-finesse-cavity-sa3-calibration.py" for the calculation of the impact of SA3 on gain and finesse; the code can also be used to make calculations without aberration
--> can be used to produce Fig3, 4 and 5

2) code "cavity_2D_magnification.py" to produce fig 5 and 6
